# How to Add YouTube Cookies for Restricted Content

1.  Create a `data` directory in the project root:
    ```bash
    mkdir data
    ```
2.  Install a browser extension like **"Get cookies.txt LOCALLY"** for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/get-cookies-txt-locally/).
3.  Go to `youtube.com` and log in to your account.
4.  Click the extension's icon and export the cookies.
5.  Save the downloaded file as `cookies.txt` inside the `data` directory you just created.

The bot will now automatically use these cookies for its downloads.
